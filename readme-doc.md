```

## Software Requirements

### Operating System
- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit recommended)
- Python 3.7+

### Python Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Required packages:
- RPi.GPIO
- spidev
- tkinter
- logging
- pytest (for testing)

## Installation

1. System Preparation
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install required system packages
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-tk python3-dev

# Enable SPI interface
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to Interface Options -> SPI -> Enable
```

2. Download and Install
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/coffee-machine.git
cd coffee-machine

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Set permissions
chmod +x run.sh
chmod +x hardware_tests.py
```

## Configuration

1. Edit configuration file:
```bash
nano config.json
```

2. Configure parameters:
```json
{
    "temperature": {
        "min": 45.0,
        "max": 60.0,
        "initial_power": 70
    },
    "flow": {
        "initial_rate": 50
    },
    "alarms": {
        "water_level_min": 10,
        "powder_level_min": 20
    }
}
```

## Usage

1. Start the System
```bash
./run.sh
```

2. GUI Operation
- Press "Start" to begin process
- Monitor temperature and levels
- Use "Stop" for normal shutdown
- Use "Emergency Stop" for immediate shutdown

3. Normal Operation Sequence
   - System performs initial checks
   - Heater starts with 70% power
   - Temperature stabilizes in 45-60째C range
   - Process runs with automatic adjustments
   - Monitors water and powder levels
   - Activates circulation if needed

## Testing

1. Run Hardware Tests
```bash
python3 hardware_tests.py
```

2. Run System Tests
```bash
python3 -m pytest system_tests.py
```

3. Test Coverage
```bash
python3 -m pytest --cov=. tests/
```

## Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- Water level
- Powder level
- Temperature sensor readings
- Motor operation
- Valve operation

### Weekly Maintenance
- Clean sensors
- Check all connections
- Verify temperature calibration
- Test emergency stop
- Check log files

### Log Files
Located in `/var/log/coffee_machine/`:
- `system.log`: System operations
- `errors.log`: Error messages
- `maintenance.log`: Maintenance records

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Temperature Out of Range
- Check thermocouple connections
- Verify heater operation
- Check circulation valve
- Verify water flow

2. Motor Issues
- Check power connections
- Verify PWM signals
- Check direction controls
- Inspect mechanical parts

3. Sensor Problems
- Clean sensors
- Check wiring
- Verify power supply
- Test signal connections

## Safety Features

### Emergency Procedures
1. Emergency Stop Button
   - Immediately stops all operations
   - Cuts power to heater
   - Stops all motors
   - Activates alarm

2. Automatic Shutoff Conditions
   - Water level < 5%
   - Powder level < 10%
   - Temperature > 60째C
   - Temperature < 45째C for extended period

3. Alarm Conditions
   - Water level < 10%
   - Powder level < 20%
   - Temperature out of range
   - System errors
